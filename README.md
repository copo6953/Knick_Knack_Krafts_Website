## Knick Knack krafts Website
####
Web application for a clients home decor / craft business built using React JS and TailwindCSS. I used React for this website so I could create reusable components for future projects. I prefer TailwindCSS because it is quicker to write and easier to maintain. The site was deployed using Route 53, S3, and CloudFront.
